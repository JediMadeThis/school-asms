# Changelog

All of the changes are listed here.

## v1.1 (2025-06-12)

### Fixed

- Past assignments showing, fixed so it won't appear as it should
- Date & time has 1 second delay before it loads, now added an immediate update function when the page loads instead of waiting for `setInterval` delay

### Changed

- Changed text "Due this week" to "Due in 7 days" to prevent misunderstanding, because it doesn't categorize if the assignment is in the same week, but actually in 7 days

## v1.0 (2025-06-10)

Initial release of the project

### Added

- Date & clock
- Assignments tracker
